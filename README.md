## FireDNS
### The new firewall for the modern Internet.

FireDNS protects you from all kinds of security threats, blocks ads and trackers on websites and in apps and provides a safe and supervised Internet for kids â€” on all devices and on all networks. While allowing you to see what's happening on your devices with in-depth analytics and real-time logs.

## Run FireDNS localy

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

>
>	MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
>
