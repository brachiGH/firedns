## FireDNS
### The new firewall for the modern Internet.

FireDNS protects you from all kinds of security threats, blocks ads and trackers on websites and in apps and provides a safe and supervised Internet for kids â€” on all devices and on all networks. While allowing you to see what's happening on your devices with in-depth analytics and real-time logs.

## Setup and run FireDNS localy

First start with creating  the .env file
